A Next.js starter application for learning how to integrate Webiny Headless CMS with Static Site Generation.

## About This Project

This is the companion repository for the **Learn Webiny - Headless CMS Course**.

By following **Lesson 8: Learn Webiny Next.js App**, you'll learn how to:

- Connect a Next.js app to Webiny Headless CMS
- Create API keys with proper permissions
- Fetch and display content using the Read API
- Implement Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Handle errors gracefully with TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A Webiny project with published products (from Lessons 1-7)
- Basic understanding of React and Next.js

cd learn-webiny-nextjs-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Follow the Lesson

This repository contains the **starter code** only. To complete the application, follow the step-by-step tutorial:

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Webiny API details:
